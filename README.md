ðŸš€ ft_transcendence â€” The Final Boss of 42's Common Core
ft_transcendence is the ultimate web development project at the end of the 42 Common Core. It challenges students to build a real-time, multiplayer Pong web application â€” and go way beyond.
Youâ€™ll touch every layer of modern fullstack development: frontend, backend, security, DevOps, AI, blockchain, and more. All while building a product thatâ€™s complex, beautiful, and fun to use.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Build a single-page web app playable in the browser

Integrate real-time Pong gameplay, live matchmaking & tournament system

Learn to work with new, unknown technologies

Implement production-ready practices: Docker, HTTPS, authentication, modular architecture, and CI/CD logic

Mandatory Stack
 Frontend: Typescript SPA

 Backend (optional): PHP (unless overridden)

 Dockerized setup

 Tournament mode

 HTTPS, hashed passwords, form validation

 Pong vs. local player (same keyboard)

Modules Implemented
  To complete ft_transcendence, we picked and implemented key modules. Some were major (required on their own), some minor (2 minors = 1 major).
  Here's what we covered:

Web
  Major: Backend with a modern framework

  Minor: Frontend with a UI toolkit (e.g. Tailwind CSS)

  Minor: SQLite integration for persistent storage
 
User Management
  Major: Full authentication system with avatars, stats, friends, match history

  Major: Google OAuth (remote login)

AI / UX
  Major: AI opponent

  Minor: Dashboards for user and game stats

Cybersecurity
  Major: JWT + Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

  Minor: GDPR compliance (anonymization, data management, account deletion)

Accessibility & Compatibility
  Minor: Multi-language support

  Minor: Broad browser compatibility

Tech Stack & Tools
  Frontend: Typescript, Tailwind CSS

  Backend: Fastify (Node.js), SQLite

  Auth: JWT, 2FA, Google OAuth

  Security: HTTPS, input validation, secure storage

  Infra: Docker, Docker Compose

  Game Engine: Canvas-based Pong w/ real-time matchmaking

DevOps: .env-based config, multi-service architecture

How to Run :

docker-compose up --build
Then visit: https://localhost 

Why it Matters
  ft_transcendence is the capstone project of the 42 Common Core.
  It consolidates everything youâ€™ve learned â€” and throws you into the unknown with real-world technologies, system design, and team collaboration.
